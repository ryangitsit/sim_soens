# Superconducting Optoelectronic Network Simulator
  - Note this a pre-refactoring branch -- for posterity's sake
![plot](./img/wafer_tilted.png)
Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks (SOENs) are an in-development neuromorphic hardware that offer *lightspeed communication* and *brain-level scalability*.\
This repo is for the coders, neuroscientists, and machine-learners that want to play with the computational properties of SOENs through simulations, based on the phenomological model linked here:
